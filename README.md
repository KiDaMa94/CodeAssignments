Purpose: To become visible to future employers and showcase what I can do.

Functionality / Features:
By keeping the pages mostly clean and simpler I have made it easy to navigate throughtout the website. By change minor details on each of the pages while keeping it as unison as possible together I hope to keep the users attention throug-out the website.

Home Page/ Welcome: is a quick view of concept and skill. It is purposely minimal in design to encourage interaction with the website.

About me page: The about me page is just a basic page set up to display my resume and a get to know me for future employers. (Currently filled mostly with Example inforamtion)

Blog example: is supposed to be viewed at as a sample page of the kind of work I can provide

Contact Page: set-up for those who wish to see work on github or those that wish to contact (Current it as example information)

Responsive layout:
The responsive layout isn't at the level I would like it to be. That would be due to lack of expierence and hitting a lot of speedbumps(lack of knowledge) along the way.

Design:
I wanted to keep it asclean and simple as possible, a more Modern take for ease of use and to make the pages overall more cohesive.

Target Audience:
For employers scouting or those who are interested in having their website designed for them.
